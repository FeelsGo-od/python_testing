"""
We've added setUp() and tearDown() methods to the test 
case class.

The setUp() method is called before each test method, 
and the tearDown() method is called after each test 
method.

We've included print statements in the setup and 
teardown methods to indicate when they are executed.




Here are some common scenarios where test fixtures are beneficial:

- Database Operations: If your code interacts with a 
database, you might need to set up a database 
connection, initialize tables, and insert test data 
before running your tests. Test fixtures can handle 
these tasks to ensure that your tests have a 
consistent database state.

- File System Operations: If your code reads from or 
writes to files, you may need to create temporary 
files or directories for testing purposes. 
Test fixtures can create and clean up these 
files to isolate tests and prevent interference 
between them.

- Network Communication: If your code communicates 
over a network (e.g., making HTTP requests), 
you might need to set up a mock server or configure 
network settings for testing. Test fixtures can handle 
these setup tasks to simulate network interactions 
without relying on external services.

- Resource Allocation: If your code uses system 
resources (e.g., memory, CPU), you might need to 
allocate and release resources during testing. 
Test fixtures can manage resource allocation and 
deallocation to prevent resource leaks and ensure 
efficient testing.

- Configuration Settings: If your code relies on 
configuration settings or environment variables, 
you might need to set up specific configurations 
for testing. Test fixtures can configure the 
environment to simulate different scenarios and 
edge cases.

- Dependency Injection: If your code depends on 
external dependencies (e.g., other modules or classes), 
you might need to mock or stub these dependencies for 
testing. Test fixtures can provide mock objects or 
stubs to isolate the code under test and verify its 
behavior independently.
